# Angular Base App

This is a simple scaffolding for angular apps with browserSync and Express server for data mocks.

## Prerequisites for Windows

We need the following apps:

* Chrome: https://www.google.es/chrome/browser/desktop/
* Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
* Node: https://nodejs.org/en/
* Ruby: http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/

## Getting Started

Just type these commands in the Git Bash console one by one.

```
git clone
npm install gulp -cli
npm install bower -cli
npm install
bower install
```

## Gulp tasks

* Default ('gulp'):
	It starts and compile the project to develop. Chrome will start automatically and inject files or refresh when you are working.

## Run the Application

Just type the following command in the Git Bash console.

```
gulp
```

## Developing

Give Git your name and email.

```
git config --global user.name "Tu nombre"
git config --global user.email "TuEmail@example.com"
```
